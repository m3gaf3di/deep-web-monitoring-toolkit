# Deep Web Monitoring Toolkit

## Overview

Welcome to the **Deep Web Monitoring Toolkit** repository! This toolkit is designed to assist cybersecurity analysts in monitoring, analyzing, and responding to potential threats originating from the deep web. The tools and scripts included here are aimed at gathering intelligence, identifying suspicious activities, and maintaining a secure environment.

## Features

- **Web Crawling & Scraping**: Tools for crawling deep web marketplaces, forums, and other sources for keywords related to potential threats.
- **Automated Reporting**: Scripts that generate reports based on data collected from deep web sources.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Tools to correlate deep web findings with known threat intelligence databases.
- **Alerting System**: Setup for notifications when specific keywords or patterns are detected in the monitored sources.
- **Data Encryption & Storage**: Secure methods to store sensitive data collected from deep web sources.
- **Anonymity & Security**: Scripts to ensure your identity and data remain secure while interacting with the deep web.

## Prerequisites

Before using the toolkit, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: Required for running most scripts.
- **Tor Browser**: For accessing the deep web securely.
- **MongoDB**: For storing collected data.
- **Selenium**: For automated browsing.
- **BeautifulSoup & Requests**: For web scraping.
- **OpenSSL**: For encrypting sensitive data.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/m3gaf3di/deep-web-monitoring-toolkit.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd deep-web-monitoring-toolkit
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Ensure the Tor Browser is installed and running. Update the `torrc` file with the following settings:

    ```bash
    # Add your custom Tor settings here
    ```

5. Configure the MongoDB database:

    ```bash
    # Setup instructions for MongoDB
    ```

## Usage

### 1. Web Crawling

To start crawling specific deep web sources:

```bash
python crawler.py --source marketplace1 --keywords "ransomware, exploit"
```

### 2. Threat Analysis

Analyze the collected data against known threat databases:

```bash
python analyze.py --database collected_data.db
```

### 3. Generate Reports

Create a detailed report based on your findings:

```bash
python report_generator.py --output report.pdf
```

### 4. Setup Alerts

Configure the alerting system to notify you of specific threats:

```bash
python alert_setup.py --keywords "data breach, carding"
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
